# Authenticity_validator
A centralized document authentication system designed for academic institutions under the same university.  This project enables institutions to securely issue and store official documents (certificates, transcripts, etc.) in a shared database. The system verifies the authenticity of uploaded documents, helping detect fake or tampered records.
